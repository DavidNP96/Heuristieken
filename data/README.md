All data is placed in this folder. The data of the different neighborhoods occurs in two format types: CSV and TXT. The
location and output of the houses is in CSV format. The location and capacity of the batteries is in TXT format. There are
3 neighborhoods and 2 files (1 TXT and 1 CSV) per neighborhood, so there is a total of 6 files.
